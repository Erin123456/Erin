Photoshop CS6 is one of softwares that I am using. Though it is really good software, it still has its own advantages and disadvantages.


Next I will give a brief description about this App. PhotoshopCS6 is a kind of application in the computer graphics with the function of photo editing and digital painting. It is used by some of photo makers or editors. It has not only almost all the essential features which the old versions of Photoshop applications have in its history that including patching picture, removing certain part of pictures and matching the colors. It also has some new features such as layer search, info tip, drawing dotted line, merging picture-layer masking-out and so on. These are the advantages compared to photoshopCS5. The layer search avoided you looking for one picture-layer from many lays, saving time and not letting you have a headache again. With info tip you can see your picture completely, avoiding opening and closing you information menu again and again.
However, the disadvantages made me feel so inconvenient and tired.


First, sometimes, the operate system suddenly crash and close automatically with no reminder information. Particularly, it happens when I just about to finish my picture and there is no time to save my work. In this case it usually drives me mad. In fact, I have experienced this case several times. So I usually save my picture every a few steps during the process of my work, for fear that the application will crash again. From the point of my view, this application should perfect the function of its automatically checking itself and giving a warn to remind users to save their work and tell the users what the problems are and how long it takes to recover.


Second, the shortcut key is also some other applications’ shortcut key. That is, when we use two or more apps at the same time, we can’t use shortcut key. because if we use shortcut key ,maybe we just changed the other apps’ situation, instead of operating ps6 as we thought. In my opinion, applications are supposed to add a function which could let users set the shortcut key as they like. In my experience, every time I use photoshopcs6 I always close the app –tencent QQ, or, I can’t use the shortcut key---ctrl+z+alt. because it is also a shortcut key in tencent QQ. And it always disturbs me and disorganized my unfinished picture.


Third, the content-aware patch tools are not so sensible. That is to say, the picture patched using the patch tools seems not to be so natural. It is always left some trace more or less. I think it should perfect its content-aware function to a better lever, in order to make a perfectly natural picture.


Last, I also want to come up with another advice. As we all know the styles of paint brush tools are not enough. The app had better give an interlinkage to lead users to buy brush tools as they need. And the app itself need not carry too much tools. Instead, the tools can be sold separately. This can not only shrink the application’s size and occupation, but also give convenience to users to choose tool products as they like.
I really expect this app to be better and better to benefit more users.
