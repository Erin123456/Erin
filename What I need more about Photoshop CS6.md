Photoshop CS6 is one of the softwares that I am using. Though it is really a good software, it still has its own advantages and disadvantages.


Next, I will give a brief description of this App. PhotoshopCS6 is a kind of application in the computer graphics with the function of photo editing and digital painting. It is used by some of the photo makers or editors. It not only has almost all the essential features which the old versions of Photoshop applications have in its history, including patching pictures, removing certain part of pictures and matching the colors. It also has some new features such as layer search, info tip, drawing dotted line, merging picture-layer masking-out and so on. These are its advantages compared to photoshopCS5. The layer search refrains you from looking for one picture-layer from many lays, this can save your time and won't let you have a headache again. With info tip, you can see your picture completely, avoiding opening and closing your information menu again and again.


However, the disadvantages made me feel so inconvenient and tired.


First, sometimes, the operate system suddenly crashes and closes automatically with no remindful information. Particularly, it happens when I am just about to finish my picture and there is no time to save my work. In this case, it usually drives me mad. In fact, I have experienced this case several times, so I usually save my picture every a few steps during the process of my work, for fear that the application will crash again. From my point of view, this application should perfect the function of automatically checking itself and giving a warn to remind users of saving their work and tell the users what the problems are and how long it will take to recover.


Second, the shortcut key is also the shortcut key of some other applications. That is, when we use two apps or more at the same time, we can’t use its shortcut key. because if we use the shortcut key ,maybe we will just change other apps’ situation instead of operating ps6 as we think. In my opinion, applications are supposed to add a function which could let users set the shortcut key as they like. In my experience, every time I use photoshopcs6, I always close the app –tencent QQ, or, I can’t use the shortcut key---ctrl+z+alt. because it is also a shortcut key in tencent QQ. And it always disturbs me and disorganized my unfinished picture.


Third, the content-aware patch tools are not so sensible. That is to say, the picture patched by the patch tools seems not to be so natural. It always lefts some trace more or less. I think it should perfect its content-aware function to a better level, in order to make a perfectly natural picture.


Last, I also want to come up with another advice. As we all know, the styles of paint brush tools are not enough. The app had better give an interlinkage to lead users to buy brush tools as they need. The app itself need not carry too much tools. Instead, the tools can be sold separately. This can not only shrink the application’s size and occupation, but also give convenience to users to choose tool products as they like.


I really expect this app to be better and better to benefit more users.
